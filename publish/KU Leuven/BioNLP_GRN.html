In order to work on the <b>patient guideline</b> events extraction part in
the <b>MUSE</b> <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> project, I was advised to exploit the methods used by the
team of KU Leuven in the BioNLP workshop. They attend this workshop to
develop and evaluate algorithms on the benchmark data set and planed to
use developed algorithms on the patient guideline events extraction
problem.

<h2 id="sec-1">GRN task definition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The GRN task contains two steps: first, extract formulas from text;
second, create GRN from extracted formulas. The algorithm used for the
second step had been developed by the task organizer, hence, the
participants only have to study the algorithm for the first step.

<h3 id="sec-1-1">GRN annotations has three levels</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Text-bound entities</b> are given both in train and test. Unlike
GENIA task, GRN task provide also trigger words and distinguish
the type of gene, protein, gene-family, <i>etc.</i> Gene, protein,
gene-family, <i>etc.</i> are called <b>genic entites</b>.
</li>
<li><b>Biomedical events and relatiosn</b> are like the simple events in
GENIA task. However, the defined relations distinguish the
passive and positive roles such as <i>Transcription_from</i> and
<i>Transcription_by</i> are defined as two events. <i>Promoter_of</i>
and <i>Master_of</i> represent the knowledge more precisely. The
argument type are strictly defined respect to the type of gene,
protein, <i>etc.</i> defined in the first level.
<font color="red">This level of annotations are called
<b>events</b> and <b>relations</b>, and it does <b>NOT</b> contain <b>recursive
events</b>.</font>
</li>
<li><b>Interactions</b> contains six types of relations: <i>Binding</i>,
<i>Transcription</i>, <i>Activatio</i>, <i>Requirement</i>, <i>Inhibition</i> and
<i>Regulation</i>. The first two types represent mechanisms, the next
three types represent effects and the last collect all the other
relations. Interactions can be <b>recursive</b>.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">Generation of network</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Thought only the level 3 annotation and the network will be submitted
to the official evaluation, the construction of GRN needs the
inference with the level 2 annotation for the interactions that do not
directly link to the genic entities.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the agent/target of an interaction is a genic named entity, the
agent/target node is the gene identifier of the entity. If the
entity does not contain gene identifier, it is not a genic
name. <font color="red">In GENIA task, there are some
protein entities that are sub-strings such as <i>Il-1,2,3</i>. Does GRN
contain similar annotations? Are they ignored (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i> do not
contain gene identifier)?</font>
</li>
<li>If the agent/target is an event, the node is the entity referenced by
the event.
</li>
<li>If the agent/target is a relation, the agent of both arguments
(agent/target) are nodes.
</li>
<li>If the agent/target is a promoter, the agent is the argument follows
the <i>promoter_of</i> or <i>master_of_promoter</i> relation.
</li>
<li>Edges are ordered by hierarchy and remove edges with lower
priority.When both (A, <i>Transcription</i>, B) and (A, <i>Regulation</i>,
B) exit, (A, <i>Transcription</i>, B) is kept.
